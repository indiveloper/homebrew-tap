  caveats <<~EOS
    Waindow requires macOS 13.1 or later.

    The current direct build uses a stable local signing identity and is not
    Developer ID notarized.
    Homebrew preserves macOS quarantine. On first launch, macOS may require:
    System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway.

    Do not disable Gatekeeper. Waindow requests Accessibility or Screen
    Recording, microphone, or camera only when a feature that needs that
    permission is explicitly used.

    For future tap releases, prefer `brew upgrade --cask indiveloper/tap/waindow`
    instead of replacing the app manually.
